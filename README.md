# Apple-Quality-Predictor
In this project, The data analytics and machine learning to revolutionize the assessment of apple quality. Using a diverse dataset encompassing attributes such as size, weight, sweetness, and acidity, our focus is on predicting the quality labels of apples using advanced algorithms. The RandomForest Classifier and Logistic Regression models are used, The robust performance is evaluated through various evaluation metrics. The feasibility analysis which isn't shared here explores technical, economic, and operational aspects, ensuring the alignment of our predictive model with real-world needs. Looking forward, the project sets the stage for future enhancements, including the incorporation of additional features, real-time data integration, and collaboration with stakeholders for a more holistic understanding. As we navigate this intersection of agriculture and data science, our project paves the way for informed decision-making, operational efficiency, and sustainable practices in the apple industry.
